<!--Introduction of Who I am-->
<h1><ins> Hello!My Name is Anthony Lopez </ins></h1>
<p> I'm the kind of person that likes to learn all the time, especially when it comes to technology. That is one of the reasons why I chose to further my career in Software Development. Currently, I reside in Las Vegas, NV, and recently moved from Albuquerque, NM. My goal after finishing this course is to move to Washington state.

<!--About Me-->
<h2><ins>About Me</ins></h2>
<p>I like the thought of always coding for one because I also want to build a video game, and there's always something to learn in coding because it is always changing. My passion to pursue going into Software Development is that I have always loved building things. I use to build intricate legos as a kid and build modules like classic cars and Gundhams.  I have always wanted to build a video game. I want to be the next person to be able to push the limits on <ins>video games such as my favorites like:</ins>
